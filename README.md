# learn-python-the-hard-way

To help me learn Python, I'm going through Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw.

It's important, though, that I keep using Github, so I will add anything I learn to this repository.

My aim is to be competent with Python so I can build fun and interesting things in my spare time.
